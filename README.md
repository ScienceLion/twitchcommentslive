## A Noita mod that brings Twitch comments to life in-game

Bring Twitch chat as floating text, turn them into physical materials at random, or have chat discover creating specific materials based on what they say.

Use the emote server to download emotes as chatters use them, use it offline to pre-populate only approved emotes, or not use it at all (replaces emotes with spaces).

To run, connect to Twitch in Noita via the options menu streaming tab. To add server, download the server, edit settings.txt to change the channel, and open start_server (You may need to download java stuff to run it).

(Work In Progress: Full release will be coming soon, before 2026)

## Options
General
- Use Emote Server: 
- Chat Lifetime: Lifetime of chat messages in-game (frames)
- Display Rate: Number of frames between chat messages appearing
- Chat In Front: If On, text will be in front of terrain and player
- Wiggle: Adjust how much text wiggles. This gives the chat a fun little animation.

- Pause in Holy Mountain: If On, text will not appear while in Holy Mountain
- Pause in Boss Area: If On, text will not appear while in Boss Area

- Conversion Material: Set of materials which convsersion selects from (wood, random, potions, powders)
- Reroll Catastrophic: If On, rerolls, but does not remove, Monstrous Powder and Deathium. This gives you a lower chance of these materials appearing and also prevents them being spammed.
